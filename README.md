<p id="description">A phone application (Android) that allows you to accumulate a database on fire prevention. The purpose of creating an application is to accumulate a database in a Google Sheets table. The purpose of developing the application is automation and centralization and bringing to uniformity the recording of work results in the field of fire prevention and the generation of reporting information. Tasks solved by the application: 1. Reduction of paper document flow including storage of archives of the results of preventive work; 2. Reducing the load on subjects of preventive work by automating processes; 3. Creation and accumulation of a database on the results of preventive work suitable for generating reporting information as well as various visualization methods (interactive analytical panels); 4. Collection of initial data to assess the degree of influence of preventive work on the operational situation with fires; 5. Preparation of initial data for integration with the fire accounting module allowing you to visualize (in the form of a cartographic representation) the situation with fires and the results of preventive work for a specific territory (settlement). Prospects: 1. Obtaining complete statistical data on the results of preventive work in a uniform and accessible form for accounting; 2. Prompt access to information on the results of preventive work in the event of fires and other cases; 3. Development of a DSS for managing a fire prevention system based on the relationship between the operational situation and the coverage of the population with preventive work. Work results: 1. State registration of a computer program with Rospatent; 2. Introduction of the program (as a pilot project) into the activities of fire prevention instructors in the Nizhny Novgorod region the Republic of Mordovia; 3. After finalization it is possible to implement (at the Federal level) as a separate module as part of the AAS KND (departmental software of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for carrying out supervisory and preventive work).</p>
